  ## Usage:
  Users can create an account by clicking on the "Register" link on the homepage. Once logged in, users are redirected to a page that displays their saved decks in the order they were created. On this page, users have the option to edit, delete, or create a new deck. The edit option redirects to a page that displays the cards (if any) within the selected deck. This page features a search field with auto-complete and card preview that allows users to add new cards. Options to remove cards from the deck and rename the deck are also available.
